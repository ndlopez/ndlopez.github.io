<p><em>December 2022</em> -- Recently I applied to a major Japanese company headquartered in Aichi. 
      The position was Numerical Researcher (Data Scientist) with R, Python and SQL experience. Unfortunately,
      due to I assume country of origin (also not fluent in Japanese) I was rejected for such position. In spite of the movement all Japanese companies seem to be following, "no discrimination on race, sex, and belief". It's kinda trending. Yes, no discrimination as long as you are from the US or from any country from Europe.</p>
      <p>In any way, I won't give up and continue applying to other companies. Given the market now I might have to move to the dense populated Tokyo or nearby. On a next post I will probably comment about it and extend my job search area to Tokyo, Kanagawa and Osaka.</p>
