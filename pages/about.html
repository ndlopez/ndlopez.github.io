      <p class="init-cap">Hello, I am Diego Lopez a Physicist, and occasional programmer who currently works in Aichi, Japan.<br>
      What it started as a hobby back in undergrad school (~2003) became a profession.<br> 
      These days I mostly do data analysis (in Python and R) and more recently front-end (in JavaScript).<br/>
      Before joining the recruiting staff company, I was doing research at Nagoya University as a grad student.</p>
      <p>I received a PhD in Astroparticle Physics from the Graduate School of Science at the 
      University of Nagoya in Japan, under the supervision of Prof. Y. Matsubara and Dr. T. Sako.<br>
      My research was generously supported by the Monbukagakusho Scholarship offered by the Japanese 
      Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.<br> 
      My dissertation thesis consisted on the study of the acceleration mechanism of 'solar neutrons' 
      during solar flares. These particles are the by-products of the originally generated (gamma-rays, protons) after a 
      solar flare occurred.</p>
      <p>
      In other accomplishments, I obtained a M.Sc degree from the Graduate School of Science of Nagoya University.<br> 
      My thesis consisted on particle identification using a prototype detector, under the supervision of also Prof. Y. Matsubara.<br> 
      I also obtained a B.Sc degree in Physics with a minor in Mathematical methods from San Andres University in Bolivia.

      <h2>What I am doing now</h2>
      <span><em>Updated February 2023</em></span>
      <p class="init-cap"> I stopped searching for a job and applying to companies here and there. Most of the local companies in the area are mainly outsourcing, like agents on athletes. Meaning, I get the chance to work but I don't get much income. I ignore why these kind of companies exist in the first place. Do the larger not want to pay benefits to employees? It's sort of a win-win situation. I mean for the recruiting company, cuz they get 100% on income and just pay the employee about 70% or less without any other benefits such as summer/winter bonus or yearly increment of salary :( <br>
      In any way, current "gig" became interesting and busy. Interesting for the CAE modelling involving a certain inner part of a car. I got busy, 'cuz most of the departments are looking to automatize processes in order to reduce work-man-hours. In any way, I am trying to help as much as possible and allowed.<br/> I noticed too that I've been taking for granted some of the tools I use and their settings for corporate environments (security and stuff). For instance, Python is not installed on the system, it's only copied on a secondary drive, thus limiting productivity. Not being installed on system some useful tools don't work by default, such as <em>pip</em>. I need to connect through a proxy server to "install" a library I might need. It's a tedious task but I have to do it in order to get things done.

      <em>January 2023</em>-- A new year has begun. I must deftly find a new job within this year. This month I started a new job at a major company as CFD (computer fluid dynamics) analyst and programmer (outsourcing job). I have to commute for 25 minutes by train and 20 minutes by company bus. <br>Lunch break is just 45 minutes, since I eat in 30 I barely have enough time to take a nap. A good point of this company is the cafeteria where they serve lunch, given my conditions it's affordable and kinda delicious. <br>Although, work ends at exact set time (no over-work policy) I have to wait for another 25 minutes for the bus to come. In those 25 minutes I can walk and almost reach a closer train station, the route is kinda scary, 'cuz people don't walk in such small town, they all use car. In any way, I hope I can last for more than 2 years there or even better get a real position at another company.<br> I also started reading a book that had never had the chance to read, "The Odyssey by Homer".
