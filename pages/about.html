      <p class="init-cap">Hello, I am Diego Lopez a Physicist, and programmer currently working in Aichi, Japan. In 2016 I received my PhD under the supervision of Professor Y. Matsubara (Nagoya University, Japan). Graduate work focused on the interactions and acceleration mechanisms of neutral particles (particularly neutrons). Subsequently, he moved to the Physics Department of Imperial College London, where she worked as a Research Associate for 4 years with Professor Stefan Maier, before transitioning to the Royal Society University Research Fellowship. In October 2017, she joined the Physics Department of Kings College London as a Research Fellow and a Lecturer, where she currently remains.
         Welcome to my web portfolio to display some of my <a target="_blank" href="projects.html">projects</a> and anything else I want to show the world.<br>What it started as a hobby back in undergrad school (~2003) became my current occupation, where I make RPA tools (in Python, Powershell and VBA) and also prepare models for CAE simulation, using LS-Dyna.<br>
      Before joining the current gig, I was making a combinatorial optimization model in Python, thus solving a logistics problem for a well-known company.</p>
      <p>I am interested in Solar Physics and High-Energy Cosmic-Rays. On next update I will upload some of the tools I used and use to perform statistical analyses and some small simulations to understand the acceleration mechanism of particles when a flare occurs. At the <a href="/research" target="_blank">research page</a> it is possible to observe some of the monitoring tools: number of sunspots and soft-X-rays.</p>
      <!--p>Barns Courtney - '99', I received a PhD in Astroparticle Physics from the Graduate School of Science at the University of Nagoya in Japan, under the supervision of Prof. Y. Matsubara and Dr. T. Sako.<br>
      My research was generously supported by the Monbukagakusho Scholarship offered by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.<br> 
      My dissertation thesis consisted on the study of the acceleration mechanism of 'solar neutrons' during solar flares. These particles are the by-products of the originally generated (gamma-rays, protons) after a solar flare occurred.</p>
      <p>
      In other accomplishments, I obtained a M.Sc degree from the Graduate School of Science of Nagoya University.<br> 
      My thesis consisted on particle identification using a prototype detector, under the supervision of also Prof. Y. Matsubara.<br> 
      I also obtained a B.Sc degree in Physics with a minor in Mathematical methods from San Andres University in Bolivia.

      <h2>What I am doing now</h2>
      <span><em>Updated August 2023</em></span>
      <p class="init-cap"> The project I got back in March will be finally released. It took 6 months basically. Mainly due to lack of information not being available on the internet. Unfortunately only available by contacting via email to the vendor who apparently does support of the software as well. I do NOT trust on support people 'cuz they dont help at all. It is definitely a waste of time. In any way, I found a way to solve the problem and I can finally see the light at the of this long tunnel.<br>In other news, I am still running on the same problem all over again. This is running a binary (exe) file in Windows. The issue is that the binary runs from the user's temp directory located at c:\Users\upYours\LocalData\Temp\, thus if paths are set inside source code, they run from such location. I had so many issues using PathLib. Something I will probably write about on the <a href="https://ndzerglink.wordpress.com">blog</a>.
