      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hello, I am Diego, a physicist working in Aichi, Japan.<br>
      What it started as a hobby back in undegrad school (~2000) became a profession.<br> 
      I mostly do back-end (Python) and recently front-end (JavaScript).</p>
      <p>Before joining the recruiting staff company I am currently at, I was working as a Python 
      programmer at the TMC Kamigo Plant.</p>
      <p>I received my PhD in Astroparticle Physics from the Graduate School of Science at the 
      University of Nagoya in Japan, under the supervision of Prof. Y. Matsubara and Dr. T. Sako.<br>
      My study was generously supported by the Monbukagakusho offered by MEXT, Japan.<br> 
      My thesis studies 'solar neutrons', which are secondary particles generated after a 
      solar flare occurred. I set upper limits for the ground detection of these particles.</p>
      <p>
      I obtained my M.Sc degree in the Graduate School of Science of Nagoya University.<br> 
      I finished my thesis on particle identification under the supervision of Prof. Y. Matsubara.<br> 
      I obtained my B.Sc degree in Physics with a minor in Mathematical methods from San Andres University, Bolivia. 
      </p>

      <h2>What I am doing now</h2><hr>
      <span><em>Updated September 2022</em></span>
      <p> Currently I am searching for a job in any Tokai(Aichi, Gifu, Mie) area in Japan.
      <br>Languages: Python / JavaScript
      <br>Main role: Front-End, Data Analysis.
      </p>
      <p>Lately (I mean for the last 3 months), I've been reading "Zealot" by Reza Aslan, a book that explores about the life of 
        Jesus of Nazareth. Being raised in a Roman catholic family, I knew little or close to nothing
        about his life. At school I probably was not that interested and so I focused more on Math and Physics.<br>
        Can't wait to finish and start another book, I already picked one Daniel Keyes'- Flowers for Algernon - a book 
        I heard while watching an episode of NewsRadio in YouTube. 
      </p>
      <p>I've been listening a lot of ThirdRock radio, the place to discover new music. If you are into Alternative ThirdRock
        please give it a try. Back at GradSchool I used to listen to news from home, but lately they've changed a lot 
        the format, and the fact the current ruling party is not of my please, makes it listen to news a lil harder. 
      </p>
      <p>Overall, I am preparing for job interviews and learning about Machine Learning methods.</p>
