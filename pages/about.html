      <p class="init-cap">Hello, I am Diego Lopez a Physicist, and occasional programmer who currently works in Aichi, Japan.<br>
      What it started as a hobby back in undergrad school (~2003) became a profession.<br> 
      I mostly do data analysis (in Python and R) and more recently front-end (in JavaScript).<br/>
      Before joining the recruiting staff company, I was doing research at Nagoya University as a grad student.</p>
      <p>I received a PhD in Astroparticle Physics from the Graduate School of Science at the 
      University of Nagoya in Japan, under the supervision of Prof. Y. Matsubara and Dr. T. Sako.<br>
      My research was generously supported by the Monbukagakusho Scholarship offered by the Japanese 
      Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.<br> 
      My dissertation thesis consisted on the study of the acceleration mechanism of 'solar neutrons' 
      during solar flares. These particles are by-products of those originally generated after a 
      solar flare occurred.</p>
      <p>
      In other accomplishments, I obtained a M.Sc degree from the Graduate School of Science of Nagoya University.<br> 
      My thesis consisted on particle identification using a prototype detector, under the supervision of Prof. Y. Matsubara.<br> 
      I also obtained a B.Sc degree in Physics with a minor in Mathematical methods from San Andres University in Bolivia.

      <h2>What I am doing now</h2><hr>
      <span><em>Updated January 2023</em></span>
      <p class="init-cap"> I am still searching for a job in any Tokai(Aichi, Gifu, Mie) area in Japan.
      <br>Main role: Front-End, Data Analysis.<br>
This month I started a new job at a major company as CFD (computer fluid dynamics) analyst and programmer (outsource job). I have to commute for 25 minutes by train and 20 minutes by bus. <br>Lunch break is just 45 minutes, since I eat in 35 I barely have enough time to take a nap. A good point of this company is the cafeteria where they serve lunch, give my condition it's affordable and delicious. <br>Although, work ends at exact set time (no over-work policy) I have to wait for another 25 minutes for the bus to come. In those 25 minutes I can walk and almost reach a closer train station, the route is kinda scary, 'cuz people don't walk in such town, they all use car. In any way, I hope I can last for more than 2 years there or even better get a real position at another company.<br> I also started reading a book that had never had the chance to read, "The Odyssey by Homer".
      </p>

      <p>December 2022 -- Recently I applied to a major Japanese company headquartered in Aichi. 
        The position was Numerical Researcher (Data Scientist) with R, Python and SQL experience. Unfortunately,
      due to I assume my age and country (not fluent in Japanese) I was rejected for such matching position.</p>
      <p>In any way, I won't give up and continue applying to other companies. Given the market I might have
        to move to the dense populated Tokyo or nearby. On a next post I will probably extend my job search area 
        to Tokyo, Kanagawa and Osaka.</p>
