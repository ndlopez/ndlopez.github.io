      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hello, I am Diego Lopez a Physicist, and occasional programmer who currently works in Aichi, Japan.<br>
      What it started as a hobby back in undergrad school (~2003) became a profession.<br> 
      I mostly do data analysis (in Python and R) and more recently front-end (in JavaScript).</p>
      <p>Before joining the recruiting staff company, I was doing research at Nagoya University as a grad student.</p>
      <p>I received a PhD in Astroparticle Physics from the Graduate School of Science at the 
      University of Nagoya in Japan, under the supervision of Prof. Y. Matsubara and Dr. T. Sako.<br>
      My research was generously supported by the Monbukagakusho Scholarship offered by the Japanese 
      Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.<br> 
      My dissertation thesis consisted on the study of the acceleration mechanism of 'solar neutrons' 
      during solar flares. These particles are by-products of those originally generated after a 
      solar flare occurred.</p>
      <p>
      In other accomplishments, I obtained a M.Sc degree from the Graduate School of Science of Nagoya University.<br> 
      My thesis consisted on particle identification using a prototype detector, under the supervision of Prof. Y. Matsubara.<br> 
      I also obtained a B.Sc degree in Physics with a minor in Mathematical methods from San Andres University in Bolivia. 
      </p>

      <h2>What I am doing now</h2><hr>
      <span><em>Updated December 2022</em></span>
      <p> I am still searching for a job in any Tokai(Aichi, Gifu, Mie) area in Japan.
      <br>Main role: Front-End, Data Analysis.
      </p>
      <!--p>September post: Lately (I mean for the last 3 months), I've been reading "Zealot" by Reza Aslan, a book that explores about the life of 
        Jesus of Nazareth. Being raised in a Roman catholic family, I knew little or close to nothing about his life. At school I probably was not that interested and so I focused more on Math and Physics.<br>
        Can't wait to finish and start another book, I already picked one Daniel Keyes'- Flowers for Algernon - a book 
        I heard while watching an episode of NewsRadio in YouTube. 
      </p>
      <p>Back at GradSchool I used to listen to news from home, but lately they've changed a lot the format, and the fact the current ruling party is not of my please, makes it listen to news a lil harder.
        Thus, lately, I've been listening a lot ThirdRock radio, the place where I discover new music. 
        If you are into Alternative Rock please give it a try. 
      </p>
      <p>Overall, I am preparing for job interviews and learning about Machine Learning methods.</p-->
      <!--p>Lately, or should I say, in recent years, most of my acquired items (bicycle, laptop, rain-gear, etc) are getting old or their time of replacement have come to. It started with my MacBook Pro, bought in 2010 and worked fine for about 2 years and then the HDD failed, I took it to a "Genius Bar", and they replaced the damaged device and made a cleanup of keyboard and display. It costed me about 7000JPY.</p>
      <p>Next, my rain/wind-breaker Mammut jacket got some internal scratches that I was able to repair by sewing.</p>
      <p>Lastly, my bicycle which I acquired in 2016 just after learning how to ride it. I went to so many places in it, the University (~40mins), Japanese school(~35mins) and ran many chores. However, last October the back tire got a puncture and after taking it to a repair, 
        they told me it needed an entire replacement of the tire and it would cost almost half of what I originally paid for the whole bicycle. Therefore, I decided to buy another.<br/><br/>In other news, I've been making a Note App for Android, since Simplenote decided to kick me out if I continue using a WordPress account to login, even though its their parent company or a product of the parent company. </p-->
      <p>Recently I applied to a major Japanese company headquartered in Aichi. 
        The position was Numerical Researcher (Data Scientist) with R, Python and SQL experience. Unfortunately,
      due to I assume my age and country (not fluent in Japanese) I was rejected for such matching position.</p>
      <p>In any way, I won't give up and continue applying to other companies. Given the market I might have
        to move to the dense populated Tokyo or nearby. On a next post I will probably extend my job search area 
        to Tokyo, Kanagawa and Osaka.</p>
