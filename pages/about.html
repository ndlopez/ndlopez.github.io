Hello, I am Diego, a physicist living in Kobe, Japan.

Due to the lack of positions in academia I could not continue with my research (pls check references for more info) and so I decided to get a job as a programmer.

Mostly back-end (Python) and most recently front-end (JavaScript), 
What it started as a hobby back in undegrad school (~2000) became a profession.

I am passionate about programming, learning new tools, and improving experiences.

More recently, I started to work as a programmer for TMC...
