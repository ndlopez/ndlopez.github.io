      <p class="init-cap">Hello, I am Diego Lopez a Physicist, and occasional programmer who currently works in Aichi, Japan.<br>
      What it started as a hobby back in undergrad school (~2003) became a profession.<br> 
      These days I mostly do data analysis (in Python and R) and more recently front-end (in JavaScript).<br/>
      Before joining the recruiting staff company, I was doing research at Nagoya University as a grad student.</p>
      <p>I received a PhD in Astroparticle Physics from the Graduate School of Science at the 
      University of Nagoya in Japan, under the supervision of Prof. Y. Matsubara and Dr. T. Sako.<br>
      My research was generously supported by the Monbukagakusho Scholarship offered by the Japanese 
      Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.<br> 
      My dissertation thesis consisted on the study of the acceleration mechanism of 'solar neutrons' 
      during solar flares. These particles are the by-products of the originally generated (gamma-rays, protons) after a 
      solar flare occurred.</p>
      <p>
      In other accomplishments, I obtained a M.Sc degree from the Graduate School of Science of Nagoya University.<br> 
      My thesis consisted on particle identification using a prototype detector, under the supervision of also Prof. Y. Matsubara.<br> 
      I also obtained a B.Sc degree in Physics with a minor in Mathematical methods from San Andres University in Bolivia.

      <h2>What I am doing now</h2>
      <span><em>Updated July 2023</em></span>
      <p class="init-cap"> I know I've been blabbering a lot about finding a better source of income. To finally settle job-wise, however, I passed another job fair held a few days ago. The truth I was not-motivated to write, yes write, a CV in Japanese. But I guess if I plan to move forward I have to start writing.<br>
        On other news, the current gig became monotone, well after 6 months I figure out my position and contribution to the group. The project I got back in March got extended for another month, I dont know if because of the lack of guidance or something else. Whatever the case, I hope I can finish it before the long rest in August. I also met again the same Japanese gossip-society that I never enjoyed while I was in Grad-school. But, what can I do? I cannot give up and return home where the situation is not better. I have to resist and endure, save some money, probably invest.<br/>
        I also decided to continue doing research on soft/hard X-rays and solar flares. Recently the Sun has become quite active, well approaching the maximum of solar-cycle 25, some flares, even M-class generated significant CMEs. Although I no longer have access to ground-observations I can make a small analysis of free-available satellite data. For the moment optimize visualization tools.
