      <p class="init-cap">Hello, I am Diego Lopez a Physicist, and occasional programmer who currently works in Aichi, Japan.<br>
      What it started as a hobby back in undergrad school (~2003) became a profession.<br> 
      These days I mostly do data analysis (in Python and R) and more recently front-end (in JavaScript).<br/>
      Before joining the recruiting staff company, I was doing research at Nagoya University as a grad student.</p>
      <p>I received a PhD in Astroparticle Physics from the Graduate School of Science at the 
      University of Nagoya in Japan, under the supervision of Prof. Y. Matsubara and Dr. T. Sako.<br>
      My research was generously supported by the Monbukagakusho Scholarship offered by the Japanese 
      Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.<br> 
      My dissertation thesis consisted on the study of the acceleration mechanism of 'solar neutrons' 
      during solar flares. These particles are the by-products of the originally generated (gamma-rays, protons) after a 
      solar flare occurred.</p>
      <p>
      In other accomplishments, I obtained a M.Sc degree from the Graduate School of Science of Nagoya University.<br> 
      My thesis consisted on particle identification using a prototype detector, under the supervision of also Prof. Y. Matsubara.<br> 
      I also obtained a B.Sc degree in Physics with a minor in Mathematical methods from San Andres University in Bolivia.

      <h2>What I am doing now</h2>
      <span><em>Updated April 2023</em></span>
      <p class="init-cap"> This month was kinda interesting. I made a new friend, who actually attended Nagoya University. So, we usually talk about the cafeteria service and other stuff about work. Talking about work, well things got difficult considering I have to built Windows binaries so they can RUN on any Windows PC on the company. I am not used to do this kind of things, or for that matter deal with such problems. As a grad student it was enough to run it on my system and if I ever had to run it on another GNU/Linux system I will just copy the source code and execute over there without much hassle.<br/> A concurrent issue I have is the inability to install any other library into the Python directory, yes directory cuz Python is actually not installed by default. Python runs from a different drive than <em>C:\</em>. I tried to proxy my way to pass the "chinese"-firewall but I couldnt.
