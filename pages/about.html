      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hello, I am Diego, a physicist working in Aichi, Japan.<br>
      What it started as a hobby back in undegrad school (~2000) became a profession.<br> 
      I mostly do data analisis (Python) and recently front-end (JavaScript).</p>
      <p>Before joining the recruiting staff company I am currently at, I was working as a Python 
      programmer at the TMC Kamigo Plant.</p>
      <p>I received my PhD in Astroparticle Physics from the Graduate School of Science at the 
      University of Nagoya in Japan, under the supervision of Prof. Y. Matsubara and Dr. T. Sako.<br>
      My study was generously supported by the Monbukagakusho offered by MEXT, Japan.<br> 
      My thesis studies 'solar neutrons', which are secondary particles generated after a 
      solar flare occurred. I set upper limits for the ground detection of these particles.</p>
      <p>
      I obtained my M.Sc degree in the Graduate School of Science of Nagoya University.<br> 
      I finished my thesis on particle identification under the supervision of Prof. Y. Matsubara.<br> 
      I obtained my B.Sc degree in Physics with a minor in Mathematical methods from San Andres University, Bolivia.

      <h2>What I am doing now</h2><hr>
      <span><em>Updated October 2022</em></span>
      <p> I am still searching for a job in any Tokai(Aichi, Gifu, Mie) area in Japan.
      <br>Main role: Front-End, Data Analysis.
      </p>
      <!--p>September post: Lately (I mean for the last 3 months), I've been reading "Zealot" by Reza Aslan, a book that explores about the life of 
        Jesus of Nazareth. Being raised in a Roman catholic family, I knew little or close to nothing about his life. At school I probably was not that interested and so I focused more on Math and Physics.<br>
        Can't wait to finish and start another book, I already picked one Daniel Keyes'- Flowers for Algernon - a book 
        I heard while watching an episode of NewsRadio in YouTube. 
      </p>
      <p>Back at GradSchool I used to listen to news from home, but lately they've changed a lot the format, and the fact the current ruling party is not of my please, makes it listen to news a lil harder.
        Thus, lately, I've been listening a lot ThirdRock radio, the place where I discover new music. 
        If you are into Alternative Rock please give it a try. 
      </p>
      <p>Overall, I am preparing for job interviews and learning about Machine Learning methods.</p-->
      <p>Lately, most of my acquired items (bicycle, laptop, rain-gear, etc) are getting old or their time of replacement have come to. It started with my MacBook Pro, bought in 2010 and worked for fine for about 2 years and then the HDD failed, I took it to a "Genius Bar" here in Nagoya, and they replaced the damaged device and made a cleanup of keyboard and display. It costed me about 7000JPY.</p>
      <p>I've been also making a Note App for Android, since Simplenote decided to kick me out if I continue using a WordPress account to login, even though its their parent company or a product of the parent company. </p>
