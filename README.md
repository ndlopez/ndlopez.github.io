<!--p>September post: Lately (I mean for the last 3 months), I've been reading "Zealot" by Reza Aslan, a book that explores about the life of 
        Jesus of Nazareth. Being raised in a Roman catholic family, I knew little or close to nothing about his life. At school I probably was not that interested and so I focused more on Math and Physics.<br>
        Can't wait to finish and start another book, I already picked one Daniel Keyes'- Flowers for Algernon - a book 
        I heard while watching an episode of NewsRadio in YouTube. 
      </p>
      <p>Back at GradSchool I used to listen to news from home, but lately they've changed a lot the format, and the fact the current ruling party is not of my please, makes it listen to news a lil harder.
        Thus, lately, I've been listening a lot ThirdRock radio, the place where I discover new music. 
        If you are into Alternative Rock please give it a try. 
      </p>
      <p>Overall, I am preparing for job interviews and learning about Machine Learning methods.</p>
      <p>November: Lately, or should I say, in recent years, most of my acquired items (bicycle, laptop, rain-gear, etc) are getting old or their time of replacement have come to. It started with my MacBook Pro, bought in 2010 and worked fine for about 2 years and then the HDD failed, I took it to a "Genius Bar", and they replaced the damaged device and made a cleanup of keyboard and display. It costed me about 7000JPY.</p>
      <p>Next, my rain/wind-breaker Mammut jacket got some internal scratches that I was able to repair by sewing.</p>
      <p>Lastly, my bicycle which I acquired in 2016 just after learning how to ride it. I went to so many places in it, the University (~40mins), Japanese school(~35mins) and ran many chores. However, last October the back tire got a puncture and after taking it to a repair, 
        they told me it needed an entire replacement of the tire and it would cost almost half of what I originally paid for the whole bicycle. Therefore, I decided to buy another.<br/><br/>In other news, I've been making a Note App for Android, since Simplenote decided to kick me out if I continue using a WordPress account to login, even though its their parent company or a product of the parent company. </p-->
